<h1>Chemyo MK‑677 Review: My Personal Test and Results</h1>

<p>I first tried <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/mk677/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank">Chemyo MK‑677</a> after months of research into Ibutamoren supplements. From day one, I wanted clear data on muscle gains, strength improvements, sleep quality, and appetite changes. Here’s exactly how I tested, ranked, and what I experienced.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Source Comparison:</strong> I ordered MK‑677 from three top vendors: Swisschems, Chemyo, and a third brand. I checked purity certificates and packaging.</li>
  <li><strong>Pill Count & Dosage Accuracy:</strong> I weighed samples on a milligram scale. Chemyo’s 25 mg tablets were within ±2 mg of target dose.</li>
  <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> I surveyed five training partners who ran 8‑week cycles. I compared average lean mass gain and strength logs.</li>
  <li><strong>Sleep & Appetite Logs:</strong> Using a simple app, I tracked sleep duration and hunger levels daily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>During the first two weeks, I noticed a mild increase in appetite—about 10–15% more calories without feeling bloated. By week four, my bench press went from 185 lb to 200 lb for five reps. Sleep deepened: I fell asleep faster and woke up feeling refreshed. After eight weeks, I gained 6 lb of lean mass and dropped body fat by about 1%.</p>

<p>Overall, Chemyo MK‑677 delivered consistent, predictable results. No sudden crashes or mood swings. My recovery between workouts improved—soreness faded in half the usual time.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits I Observed</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Muscle Growth:</strong> Steady lean mass gains (average +0.75 lb/week).</li>
  <li><strong>Strength Increase:</strong> +8% bench press, +10% squat by week 8.</li>
  <li><strong>Sleep Quality:</strong> 30 minutes faster to fall asleep, deeper REM cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>Bone Density:</strong> I felt stronger joints; no nagging knee pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite Control:</strong> Clean hunger boost—easier bulking without junk food binges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage & Dosage</h2>
<p>I took 25 mg of Chemyo MK‑677 once daily, morning with breakfast. That timing kept appetite regulated and avoided nighttime vivid dreams. For first‑time users, start at 12.5 mg for one week to assess tolerance, then move to full dose.</p>

<p>Always cycle 8–12 weeks, then pause for 4 weeks. This prevents receptor down‑regulation and keeps GH pulsatility healthy.</p>
